This directory contains all files for a specific team's controller.

simSetup.m - The setup routine
	This function is run before the simulation is started. Any variables that your simulation
	needs should be declared in the function. The last action of the function is 
	to save the function's workspace for use by the simulation.

Hardware Model - The Simulink model that runs the hardware system
	This model must have the words "Hardware" somewhere in the name, with a file
	extension of .slx or .mdl (in version R2016a format).
	The state8 signal vector should be connected to a ToWorkspace block saving
	to a variable by the name of "yout" with the format "structure with time".

Software Model - The Simulink model that runs the software simulation
	This model must have the words "Software" somewhere in the name, with a file
	extension of .slx or .mdl (in version R2016a format).
	The state8 vector should be connected to an output block with the name "output".
	The model should be configured (inside the "Data Import/Export" pane of the configuration
	window) to save the output as yout as a "Structure with time).

Other files can be included in this folder if they are needed by your setup script
or simulation. This directory will be on the path when the simulation is run.
